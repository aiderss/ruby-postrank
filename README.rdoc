= Ruby PostRank
A simple wrapper around the PostRank.com REST API. I've tried to keep the
API simple without it being a bare API wrapper.

= Walkthrough
I've tried to keep the API as simple as possible. It's about one step above
the bare PostRank API. Hopefully the added abstraction is useful. The
easiest way to explain this is probably to show an example. So, here we go.

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'postrank'
  
  include PostRank
 
  conn = Connection.instance
  conn.appkey = "everburning.com/ruby-postrank" 
  eb = Feed.find_by_url("http://everburning.com")
  
  puts "The GREAT everburning feeds"
  eb.entries(:level => Level::GREAT).each do |entry|
    puts entry
  end
  
  puts "\nThe top 5 posts in the last week on everburning"
  eb.topposts(:period => Period::WEEK).each do |entry|
    puts "#{entry.title} -- #{entry.postrank} -- #{entry.postrank_color}"
  end
  
  puts "\nGet thematic PostRanked items"
  PostRank::PostRank.calculate(["http://flickr.com/photos/14009462@N00/2654539960/",
                    "http://www.flickr.com/photos/21418584@N07/2447928272/",
                    "http://www.flickr.com/photos/pilou/2655293624/"]).each do |entry|
    puts "#{entry.original_link #{entry.postrank}"
  end
  
  puts "\nGet PostRanked items"
  PostRank::PostRank.calculate(['http://everburning.com/news/on-recent-media/',
                    'http://everburning.com/news/californication/',
                    'http://everburning.com/news/the-weary-traveler/'],
              :feeds => [eb]).each do |entry|
    puts "#{entry.original_link #{entry.postrank}"
  end


That's basically it.
